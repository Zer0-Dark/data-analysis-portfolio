The main objective of the project is to understand how sales trends, regional behavior, and environmental factors such as temperature, wind speed, humidity, and visibility influence sales performance and recall patterns.The data sources for this project were provided as multiple Excel files. These files were consolidated, cleaned, and transformed using Python, primarily leveraging the Pandas and NumPy libraries. During this stage, missing values, inconsistent formats, and duplicated records were handled to ensure data quality and reliability.Before loading the data into Power BI, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed using Matplotlib and Seaborn. This step helped in understanding relationships between variables, identifying trends, seasonality, and anomalies, and validating key assumptions related to sales and weather indicators.The cleaned dataset was then imported into Power BI, where a structured data model was designed using proper relationships between fact and dimension tables. Advanced DAX measures and calculated columns were created to compute key performance indicators such as total profit, quantity sold, average profit per sale, monthly and quarterly trends, and system-level recall metrics.The final outcome consists of four well-designed dashboards:A Sales Overview Dashboard that highlights overall sales, profit trends, and performance by model and city.A Weather Indicators Dashboard that monitors temperature, wind speed, humidity, visibility, and weather conditions over time.A Key Influencers Dashboard that identifies the most influential factors behind recalls and system failures.A Geographical & Recall Analysis Dashboard that visualizes regional performance and affected vehicle systems across different locations.Overall, this project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from raw Excel data, moving through Python-based data cleaning and analysis, and ending with professional, insight-driven Power BI dashboards that support data-driven decision-making.",
